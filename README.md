# Explore-TypeScript

Welcome to **Explore-TypeScript**!  
This repository is a hands-on, example-driven guide for learning TypeScript fundamentals, features, and best practices. It is organized by topic and includes code samples, exercises, and solutions.

> **Note:**  
> All the concepts, examples, and exercises in this repository are based on the excellent [Getting Started with TypeScript](https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-typescript/) course from [Dometrain](https://dometrain.com/).  
>  
> Special thanks to the course author for providing clear explanations and practical examples.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Explore-TypeScript
   ```

2. **Install TypeScript (if not already installed)**
   ```sh
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

3. **Open in VS Code**
   - Open the folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Recommended: Install the official [TypeScript extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

4. **Run TypeScript files**
   - Compile and run any `.ts` file using:
     ```sh
     tsc path/to/file.ts && node path/to/file.js
     ```
   - Or use the built-in VS Code terminal and "Run" button.

5. **Explore and Experiment**
   - Each folder contains focused examples and exercises.
   - Try editing code, running exercises, and experimenting with your own changes.

## 📝 Learning Approach

- **Read the code**: Each file is heavily commented and includes both examples and exercises.
- **Try the exercises**: Most files include questions or tasks—try solving them before looking at the answers.
- **Experiment**: Change types, add new properties, and see how TypeScript responds.
- **Check errors**: Many files demonstrate what happens when you break the rules—read the comments and try it yourself.

## 💡 Tips

- Use **hover** in VS Code to see inferred types.
- Try intentionally breaking the code to see TypeScript's helpful error messages.
- Use the **Problems** tab in VS Code to quickly find type errors.
